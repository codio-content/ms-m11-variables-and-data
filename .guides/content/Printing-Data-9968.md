## Printing

1. Use the command `print()` and put your variable in the parenthesis.

- `print(x)`
- `print(y)`
- `print(name)`

1. Use the command `print()` and put a word or value in the parenthesis.

- `print('hello')`
- `print(5)`

1. Use the command `print()` with a combination of variables and values.  

- `print('hello',name)`

1. Use the command `print()` with special `%s` or `%d` symbol.  These symbols substitute the variable into a sentence you have typed in the print command

- `print('I am %d years old' % age)`
- `print('%s is my name' % name)`

What do you think the difference is between `%d` and `%s`?
