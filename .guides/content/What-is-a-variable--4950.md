# Variables

Lets think back to the macaroni and cheese recipe you wrote.  Most likely you wrote out steps to create the dish but you may not have thought about all of the ingredients. 

Without the ingredients you could not have made the dish.  Also depending on the amount of ingredients or variety of ingredients you could change the way the dish turned out. 

The "ingredients" of a program are what we call variables.

# Role and Function 

A variable is mainly a storage location with some type of identifying name.  This variable holds information that can be used for manipulation at later time. 

We are going to look at simple data types for variables at this time.  They will hold numbers, characters, etc. Think back to the algorithm you stepped through that had x, y, and z as values and then printed them out. Each of those were variables. 

x, y, and z were all variables of integer data types.
